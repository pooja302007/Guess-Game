## Features
- Random number generation
- User input for guessing the number
- Feedback on guesses (too high or too low)
- Displays the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number
- Score system that starts at 100 points and decreases with each incorrect guess

## How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. Enter your guess (a number between 1 and 100).
3. The program will inform you if your guess is too high or too low.
4. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.
5. Once guessed correctly, the program will display the number of attempts taken and your final score.

## Score System
The game starts with a score of 100 points. For each incorrect guess, the score decreases by 10 points. The final score is displayed once the player correctly guesses the number, along with the number of attempts taken to guess it.
